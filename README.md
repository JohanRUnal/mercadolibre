Mercadolibre is absolutely one of the most important companies of e-commerce in the world. For many years it has been a reference of innovation and still look itself as a "*Startup*", where there are still a lot of work to do, curiously that simple but powerful point of view definitely is a captstone of its philosophy and success!.

In this project we are interested in analyse its great public API called **MELI** , where we can access to some information of a huge amount of selling posts that are already allow in their current platform. Our goal will be create a "*full pipeline*" as is described below.

- **Data collection**: Collect data from the MELI API using a scraper.

- **Preprocessing and data cleaning** : Clean the raw data and make some feature engineering tasks. 
- **Exploratory analysis**: We are interested in the extraction of insights, patterns and anomalies.
- **Modelling stage**: We'll try to create a model that  let us "*predict*" the **sold quantity** of products that belong to different categories.
